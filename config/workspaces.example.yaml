# Tmux Claude Matrix - Workspace Configuration
#
# Define workspaces that group multiple repositories together.
# When you select a workspace, all its repos are cloned into a single
# directory and Claude is launched with access to all of them.
#
# Place this file at: ~/.tmux-claude-matrix/workspaces.yaml
